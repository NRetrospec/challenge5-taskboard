## Overview
The Task Management Application is a web-based tool designed to assist users in managing their tasks efficiently. This application allows users to create, modify, and delete tasks while visualizing them through a Kanban-style interface, enabling them to track task progress across various stages such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

## Features
Create Tasks: Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, and due date.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks can be easily moved between different status lanes (To Do, In Progress, Done) using drag-and-drop gestures.

Dynamic Color Coding: The application uses dynamic color coding to indicate task status and urgency:
Red for "To Do"
Yellow for "In Progress"
White/light for "Done"

Due Date Management: Tasks are color-coded based on their due dates, with overdue tasks highlighted accordingly.
Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks at any time, and changes are persisted via local storage.
Responsive Design: application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across various devices.
